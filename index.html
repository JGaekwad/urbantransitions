<h2>Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“the <strong>innate</strong> tendency to focus on life and lifelike
processes” E.O. Wilson (1986)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“a person is a <strong>biological organism</strong>, a social being,
and a <strong>unique individual</strong>” Y.-F. Tuan (1990)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do we need to add a <em>people</em> dimension to the existing
biophilic design dimensions of <em>nature</em> and <em>place</em>?</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The Biophilia Hypothesis suggests that the human-nature connect is
‘innate’ i.e. genetic/biological. However humans also have individual
characteristics. Could these individual characteristics be significant
when considering human-nature connection?</li>
<li>Research question: “To what extent does individual relationship with
nature influence psychological and physiological response to nature
exposure?”</li>

<ul>
<li>Previous work (clickable links) were meta-analyses considering
emotion (biophilia) and stress (Stress Recovery Theory)
respectively.</li>
<li>Used to evidence the effect of humans on nature, and design the main
study.</li>
<li>Attention was also considered, but there was already a meta-analysis
of sufficient quality published. Less work for me :)</li>

<h2>Laboratory Study</h2>
<p>Sixty-one participants</p>

<ul>
<li>Within-subjects laboratory experiment exposing 61 participants to

<li>Use of a stressor (Trail Making Test B)</li>
<li>Images are ‘typical’ of natural and urban areas able to be accessed
by someone living in Melbourne or Geelong</li>
<li>Images were rated on a custom aesthetic scale based on restorative
environment theory. The most and least restorative environments were
selected for natural and urban scenes respectively.</li>

<h2>Laboratory study</h2>
<p>Collection of rich quantitative &amp; qualitative data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collection of quantitative (emotion, attention, stress), qualitative
(critical incident method), and gaze (eye tracking) data</li>
<li>Data analysis is still in progress, this presentation contains
preliminary results for emotion only.</li>
<li>PANAS is a 20 item state affect scale with 10 items generally
considering positive affect and 10 items generally considering negative
affect). Combined valence and arousal through weighting of each
item//emotion.</li>
<li>Affect is a ‘simplification’ of more complex emotions. Affect
considers valence (positive or negative) and arousal (weak or strong).
Emotion is a more complex construct.</li>
<li>Affect is an important outcome variable as the Biophilia Hypothesis
posits an emotional connection with nature.</li>

<li>CNS is the Connectedness to Nature Scale. The participants were
split into three groups (low-blue, medium-orange, high-green).</li>
<li>The outcome variable is Positive Affect</li>
<li>Response to nature is on the left, urban is on the right</li>
<li>A result of 0 indicates that the environment had no effect. This is
roughly seen for nature on the left for all CNS groups.</li>
<li>However, the low CNS group has a much poorer response to the urban
environment (i.e. the urban environment reduces their positive
affect)</li>
<li>These results suggest that differences in individual connection to
nature do influence human response to nature!</li>

<li>Similar graph setup to the previous slide, however the individual

<ul>
<li>Similar to the previous two, however both the outcome variable and
the individual characteristic are different here.</li>
<li>The individual characteristic is a question contributing to ‘life
stress’ - how often a participant felt they were unable to control the
important things in their life.</li>
<li>The outcome variable is ‘Irritability’</li>
<li>As previous, a 0 means that the environment had no effect</li>
<li>The results indicate that people with a higher life stress gain a
greater benefit from nature i.e. the natural environment reduces their
irritability more. Similarly, the urban environment makes them more
irritable.</li>
<li>People with a lower life stress have similar responses to both
natural and urban environments - both make them a little bit irritable!
This could be due to the duration of the environment image display (10
mins) or the duration of the study (nominally 60 minutes but up to 100
minutes for some participants).</li>
<li>The magnitude of the effect here is much smaller than the previous
results. This begs the question - does this statistical effect have any
practical effect?</li>
</ul>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p>The data suggest that individual characteristics <strong>do</strong>
<em>weakly</em> influence the effects of nature</p>
<p>Urban scenes have a greater negative effect on individuals with:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower connection to nature</li>
<li>higher life stress</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>There is evidence to indicate that individual characteristics,
including long-term stress state and connection to nature, can influence
the effects of nature.</li>
<li>Data analysis is incomplete, but suggests that this individual
effect is weak - this conclusion would correspond to the biophilia
hypothesis and its biological basis.</li>
<li>Results indicate that lower connection to nature results in a higher
reduction of positive affect from urban scenes</li>
<li>Similar with higher life stress and higher reduction of positive
effect from urban scenes</li>
<li>Do we need to account for a human dimension to nature-based
design?</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="limitations" class="slide level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Individuals with lower connection to nature are a minority</li>
<li>Lossy acquisition of some physiological data</li>
<li>Laboratory rather than immersion</li>
<li>Non-extreme environments</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Sample size is decent, however more homogeneous than I would have
liked - need to significantly oversample to represent minorities
(e.g. lower connection with nature).</li>
<li>A quantitative experimental method may not be suitable for studying
such a minority in the future - other methods (e.g. deeper qualitative
methods such as longitudinal studies) should be considered for future
research.</li>
<li>I’m also working with significant data loss:
<ul>
<li>Pulse signal data loss (HR, HRV) in both time and frequency domains
due to shortcomings in the Empatica E4 sensor for this sort of research
work.</li>
<li>Eye tracking due to people having corrective lenses, and the
difficulty of accounting for head movement.</li>
<li>I’m currently using Python image processing and machine learning to
tackle this - it is a work in progress. Please reach out to me if you’re
interested in this work - might present at a conference in the
future.</li>
<li>Still exploring the significance of what a point or half point
difference in the results mean. Statistically significant, yes, but any
significant effect on well-being? This is a large and probably difficult
question to solve.</li>
