## Abstract
The influence of nature and nurture in our relationships to nature, and implications for design

The Biophilia Hypothesis posits a beneficial and innate biological connection between humans and nature. But do we all hold the same connection at our core, or does our learning, experience and culture set us apart? We present initial quantitative and qualitative findings from an experimental research project on Biophilia, Biophilic Design, and our individual differences.

The main experimental study was conducted from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024. This study considered the impact of nature and individuality on the cognition, emotion, and physiological stress-state of participants. Whilst primarily quantitative methods were applied, a supporting qualitative method was also used to deepen the exploration of the individual relationship with nature of each participant. The preliminary emotion-realted results of this study are presented, and their relevance to the research objective ‘does individuality influence human connection to nature’ discussed.

The results of the project are discussed from the perspectives of both environmental psychology and architectural design. It is hoped that the outcome of this project will inform better nature-based solutions in the design of the urban fabric from individual building to city-scale.
