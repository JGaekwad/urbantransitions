## Abstract
The influence of nature and nurture in our relationships to nature, and implications for design

The Biophilia Hypothesis suggests an innate biological connection between humans and nature, yet questions remain about how individual experiences and culture influence this relationship. This mixed-methods study investigated how personal differences affect human responses to nature, measuring cognitive, emotional, and physiological reactions in a laboratory study. Through quantitative analysis supported by qualitative exploration, I examined how individual characteristics modulate the human-nature connection. My findings, particularly regarding emotional responses, challenge the universality of biophilic responses and suggest variations in how individuals respond to natural and urban environments.
